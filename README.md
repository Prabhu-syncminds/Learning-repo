# Learning & Research Repo

This repository contains my personal notes, references, and experiments while 
learning about AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Structure
- `notes/` → Markdown notes & summaries
- `references/` → Paper links & citations
- `experiments/` → Code notebooks and small tests
- `todo.md` → Roadmap & tasks

## Goals
- Build structured knowledge over time
- Summarize key papers in simple terms
- Run small experiments to test concepts
