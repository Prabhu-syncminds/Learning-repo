## What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?
- An AI system trained on massive amounts of text (books, articles, websites, code, etc.).
- Uses deep learning, especially a type called transformers, to understand and generate human-like text.
- Instead of memorizing text, it learns patterns, relationships, and context in language.

## How it works (high-level):
  1. Training – The model is fed billions of words and learns statistical relationships (e.g., what words are likely to follow others).
  2. Tokens – Text is broken into chunks ("tokens"), and the model predicts the next token.
  3. Parameters – LLMs have millions to trillions of "parameters" (like weights in a neural network) that adjust during training.
  4. Inference – When you ask a question, the model uses what it learned to generate the most probable answer.

## Examples of LLMs:
- GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-5 (OpenAI → ChatGPT)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- LLaMA (Meta)
- PaLM, Gemini (Google DeepMind)

## Applications of LLMs:
- Chatbots & virtual assistants
- Text summarization
- Code generation
- Translation
- Search engines
- Content creation
