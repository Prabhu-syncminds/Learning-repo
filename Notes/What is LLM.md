# What is LLM

An **LLM** (Large Language Model) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand, generate, and process human-like text, typically using deep learning and neural network architectures known as **transformers**.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_5]

## Core Features of LLMs

- **Deep Neural Networks**: LLMs use advanced neural networks to analyze relationships between words, capture context, and generate coherent output.[^1_5][^1_7]
- **Training Data**: They are trained on massive datasets—ranging from billions to trillions of words—gathered from sources like books, websites, and articles.[^1_2][^1_6][^1_1]
- **Unsupervised and Self-Attention Learning**: Transformers allow LLMs to learn context and meaning across entire sequences rather than just single steps, making them powerful for text generation and understanding.[^1_7][^1_2]
- **Parameters**: The model’s learning capacity depends on parameters, with state-of-the-art models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 having hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters.[^1_3]


## Applications of LLMs

- Text generation and summarization.[^1_1][^1_3]
- Conversational AI (chatbots, assistants).[^1_3]
- Language translation and correction.[^1_6][^1_3]
- Code generation, debugging, and software automation.[^1_1][^1_3]
- Multimodal reasoning, such as combining text and images for complex tasks.[^1_8][^1_3]


## Difference Between NLP and LLM

- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** is a broad field focused on the development of algorithms for language understanding.
- **LLMs** are a subset of NLP, specifically powerful models for generating and comprehending human-like text and content.[^1_3]


## Notable Examples

- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Llama (Meta)
- Bing Chat (Microsoft)
- GitHub Copilot (for code)[^1_8][^1_1]

LLMs have quickly become the foundation of modern generative AI systems and are widely adopted across industries for a range of natural language tasks.[^1_6][^1_7][^1_8]
