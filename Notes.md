🔹 What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?
•	An AI system trained on massive amounts of text (books, articles, websites, code, etc.).
•	Uses deep learning, especially a type called transformers, to understand and generate human-like text.
•	Instead of memorizing text, it learns patterns, relationships, and context in language.

🔹 How it works (high-level):
1.	Training – The model is fed billions of words and learns statistical relationships (e.g., what words are likely to follow others).
2.	Tokens – Text is broken into chunks ("tokens"), and the model predicts the next token.
3.	Parameters – LLMs have millions to trillions of "parameters" (like weights in a neural network) that adjust during training.
4.	Inference – When you ask a question, the model uses what it learned to generate the most probable answer.

🔹 Examples of LLMs:
•	GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-5 (OpenAI → ChatGPT)
•	Claude (Anthropic)
•	LLaMA (Meta)
•	PaLM, Gemini (Google DeepMind)

🔹 Applications of LLMs:
•	Chatbots & virtual assistants
•	Text summarization
•	Code generation
•	Translation
•	Search engines
•	Content creation
